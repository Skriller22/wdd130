                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Matthew Remington and I am from Orem,
                    Utah. I have a wide array of hobbies which mainly include 
                    cooking, gaming, and fiddling with anything electronic. I've been
                    around technology for my entire life and have always enjoyed exploring
                    complex topics like math or history. I love seeing seemingly simple things
                    work together to make complex and beautiful things. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently living in Rexburg Idaho and am working 
                    towards a career in web systems engineering. It's a bit 
                    of a lofty goal, buf I am excited to see where this course 
                    takes me. I hope that whatever the case, I get to improve 
                    my understanding of the internet and how to use it to acheive 
                    my goals of helping the internet be a safe and productive space.
                </p>

                        the federal or the state government. The region was inhabited as early as 10,000 BCE."
