            <p>
                Hello! My name is Matthew Remington and I am from Orem,
                Utah. I have a wide array of hobbies which mainly include 
                cooking, gaming, and fiddling with anything electronic. I've been
                around technology for my entire life and have always enjoyed exploring
                complex topics like math or history. I love seeing seemingly simple things
                work together to make complex and beautiful things. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently living in Rexburg Idaho and am working 
                towards a career in web systems engineering. It's a bit 
                of a lofty goal, buf I am excited to see where this course 
                takes me. I hope that whatever the case, I get to improve 
                my understanding of the internet and how to use it to acheive 
                my goals of helping the internet be a safe and productive space.
            </p>

            <p>Utah is notable for it's high LDS population and technological innovation.
                Though outside of the bustling cities, Utah is full of natural wonders. 
                Take Arches national park for example (pictured above).
